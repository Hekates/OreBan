<h2 name="about">About this project</h2>

OreBan is a relatively simple Plugin which provides the ability for admins to ban specific players from mining previously specified ores.
It could be a great punishment for using XRay.

<em><b>Note:</b> This plugin is currently in the are-alpha stage which means that many core features aswell as the design isn't finished ore even done yet, so I wouldn't recommend using this plugin on a public server.</em>
